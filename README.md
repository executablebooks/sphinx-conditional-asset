Conditionally add assets (JS and CSS) to your Sphinx build.

This package allows you to choose certain pages on which to load conditional
assets, rather than forcing you to load assets for all pages. This allows you to avoid loading scripts and CSS on pages that do not need them.
It is meant primarily for Sphinx developers, but can be used as a part of any Sphinx build.

For more information, see the [`sphinx-conditional-asset` documentation](https://sphinx-conditional-asset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
